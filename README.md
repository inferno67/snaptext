üñ•Ô∏è Usage (Standalone Windows App)

If you don‚Äôt want to install Python or dependencies, download the SnapText.exe from the Releases section.

Download SnapText.exe from the latest release.

Place it anywhere you like (Desktop, Documents, etc.).

Open a terminal or PowerShell and navigate to the dist folder:
```bash
cd path\to\SnapText\dist
.\SnapText.exe
```

Double-clicking SnapText.exe in dist/ also works.

All GUI features work exactly like the Python version.

For Tesseract OCR to work, make sure Tesseract is installed and in PATH (or follow the embedded instructions for Windows).

‚ö° Notes
Make sure Tesseract is installed and correctly added to your system PATH.

For best results, use high-resolution images.

Multi-language OCR requires the corresponding Tesseract language files.

Preprocessing options (Grayscale, CLAHE, Noise Removal, Sharpening, Adaptive Thresholding) can be customized and saved as presets.

The standalone .exe version works on Windows without Python, but still requires Tesseract OCR for text extraction.
